Bridge Status & Configuration GUI

Operates the T1S/100BASE-T bridge over the EDBG COM port (115200 8N1):
bridge parameters, LAN8651 registers, IEEE test modes, and a terminal.

Standalone apart from two pip packages: sv-ttk (required, for the theme) and pyserial
(optional, without COM port access the tool still runs) - dep_check.py
checks both at startup and offers to run setup_venv.bat if needed.
Also needs bridge_config.json (lives in the json folder in the repo root, two levels above
this script). No cli.py, no test_lan8651.py --
those open the COM port themselves and collide with this GUI's connection,
because the port is exclusive under Windows. All commands go through the
one open link.

Version 1.0

This GUI provides an interface to the T1S/100BASE-T Bridge firmware.

TABS:
- Bridge Parameters: Read/write bridge configuration (IP, MAC, PLCA)
- LAN8651 Registers: Direct register access with individual read/write
- Test Modes: Apply IEEE test modes and run diagnostic scripts
- Help: This page

FEATURES:
- Individual Read/Write: Each parameter/register has its own Read/Write button
- Bulk Operations: Read/Write all bridge parameters or registers at once
- JSON Persistence: Save configuration to file and reload it
- Threading: Long-running operations don't freeze the GUI
- Status Updates: Real-time feedback on each operation

WORKFLOW:
1. Select the correct COM port (e.g., COM8)
2. Use Read Environment to fetch current state from bridge
3. Edit values as needed
4. Use Write All to apply changes to bridge
5. Use Save to JSON to persist configuration

REGISTER ACCESS:
- Addresses use MMS encoding (upper 16 bits = bank, lower 16 bits = offset)
- Examples: 0x000308FB = Test Mode, 0x0004CA02 = PLCA_CTRL1
- Always read back after write to verify

TEST MODES:
- Modes 1-4 disconnect the link during the test
- Use testmode command for automatic readback and verification
- See docs/LAN8651_TEST_MODES.md for measurement setup

CLI COMMAND:
python cli.py --port COM8 --read 1 "<command>"

Example commands:
  stats              - Show traffic statistics
  lan_read 0x0004CA02      - Read PLCA_CTRL1
  lan_write 0x0004CA02 0x80    - Write PLCA_CTRL1
  testmode 1         - Apply test mode 1
  mirror 1           - Enable port mirror (this bridge's own T1S traffic only)
  sniffer 1          - Enable sniffer (ALL T1S traffic, incl. other nodes)
